1.3. Jinja2
===========

[Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/)
is the template engine on which Flask depends.

MarkupSafe
----------

Jinja's only dependency is the package
[MarkupSafe](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MarkupSafe).
It implements HTML escaping, a core feature for a template engine.

API
---

In general you won't need to deal with Jinja's
[API](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/api/) itself,
as Flask wraps it nicely for you
(with a default `templates` folder, and the `render_template` function).
So just a few points:

* You will always have an **Environment** object that handles common tasks:
  stores configuration (such as the `autoescape` parameter) and
  global variables (`globals`, a dictionary available for all templates),
  loads templates (generally from a directory or package), etc.
* Templates themselves are instances of **Template**, which implements
  the necessary `render` method.
* Autoescaping is set to `False` as default.

Template language
-----------------

The [language](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/templates/)
you use within the templates themselves is quite simple.
The very basics:

* `{{ ... }}` is used for expressions to be evaluated (i.e.: pure variables).
* `{% ... %}` is used for statements (if, for, etc.).
* `{# ... #}` is used for comments.

A few things to note on expressions:

* Global variables, plus the ones passed in when rendering,
  are directly accessible within the template (`{{ foo }}`),
  and even attributes of a variable (`{{ foo.bar }}`).
* Filters can be added to modify a variable, with this notation:
  `{{ var | filter }}`.
  There are many builtin filters, such as `capitalize`, `trim` or
  `safe` (for disabling escaping).
  You can also add your own filters.

Some examples of control structures:

* You can use the common `if`, `for` and similar structures.
  Just remember to close them all:

  ```html
  {% if var %}
    {{ whatever }}
  {% else %}
    {{ something_else }}
  {% endif %}
  ```
* You can define a variable within the template:

  ```python
  {% set var = whatever %}
  ...
  ```

And probably the key feature of templating: inheritance!

* Create a base template, with one or more blocks within (say `layout.html`):

  ```html
  <html>
    <head>
      ...
    </head>
    <body>
      {% block content %}
      {% endblock %}
    </body>
  </html>
  ```

* Then each particular template inherits from it:

  ```html
  {% extends `layout.html` %}

  {% block content %}
    ...
  {% endblock %}
  ```

* This way you can easily handle common imports, layout, etc.

There are many more tools you can find in the official documentation.
