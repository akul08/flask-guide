1.1. HiperText Transfer Protocol
================================

[HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)
is just the simple protocol that handles web communications between:

* **clients**: web browsers or applications requesting data, and
* **servers**: machines storing and delivering that data.

In this context, we speak of:

* **requests**: from a client to a server, asking for some resource, and
* **responses**: from the server back to the client, sending it.

Current version of HTTP is HTTP/1.1.

Uniform Resource Locator
------------------------

(Beware that URLs are a subset of URIs, which include both URLs and URNs.
This distinction is not crucial for us just now.)

An [URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_locator)
is a reference to a resource that specifies its location.
Or put it simpler, a web address. It has (some of) these ordered parts:

* **scheme**: `http`, `https`, `ftp`, etc.
  Defines how the resource will be obtained.
* `://`: a mandatory separator.
* **host**: usually a **domain name**, but sometimes a literal **IP address**.
* **port**: optional (each scheme has its default), given as `:<int>`.
* **path**: the part which specifies the resource requested.
  It always starts with `/`.
* **query string**: optional, contains data to be passed to the server.
  Starts with `?`, and subsequent `<name>=<value>` pairs are separated by `&`.
* **fragment identifier**: optional, refers to a specific location within
  the resource as an identifier. Given as `#<id>`.

So, a full example will be something like this:

  ```
  <scheme>://<host>:<port>/<path>?<query_string>#<fragment_id>
  ```

Domain names and IP addresses
-----------------------------

The [IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address)
is a string (four 8-bit numbers separated by periods) that uniquely identifies
any computer connected to the Internet (either as client or server).

As IP Addresses are not themselves descriptive, generally
[domain names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name) are used instead.
They are the common strings (`www.example.com`) that generally define
a computer on the Internet. The dotting notation serves as a
namespacing tool: domain 'com', subdomain 'example', subdomain 'www'.

In practice, special servers along the way translate
domain names to IP addresses when necessary through the
[Domain Name System (DNS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System),
so you don't need to care that much.

Request methods
---------------

HTTP defines several
[methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods)
(or _verbs_) to specify the desired action of a request. These are:

* **GET**: used to _retrieve_ data, with no other effects.
* **HEAD**: identical to GET, but asks just for the headers,
  without the actual content.
* **POST**: used to _send_ data for the server to accept it as
  a new subordinate of the resource identified by the URL.
  Usually handled in the client through a web form.
* **PUT**: request that the data sent be stored under the supplied URL.
* **DELETE**: request to delete the resource identified by the URL.
* **OPTIONS**: returns the methods that the server supports
  for the specified URL.

And others: **TRACE**, **CONNECT** and **PACTH**.

GET, HEAD, TRACE and OPTIONS are defined as _safe_, which means they should
be used just for data retrieval, and so never change the state of the server.

Response status codes
---------------------

Every HTTP response begins with a 3-digit
[status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes)
that specifies the result of the request (such as if it succeeded or not).
They are classified by its first digit.
Of course, we won't mention here but the most common.

* **1xx**: Informational, for provisional, body-less responses.
* **2xx**: Success. The most common code is:
  * **200 OK**.
* **3xx**: Redirection. The most common is:
  * **302 Found**.
* **4xx**: Client Error. There are many of these, but the most common is:
  * **404 Not Found**.
* **5xx**: Server Error. The most common is:
  * **500 Internal Server Error**.

Request and response structures
-------------------------------

Every request follows this structure:

* The **request line**: `<method> <path> <version>`.
  Or something like this: `GET /user/login HTTP/1.1`.
* The **headers** (more on these in a minute).
* An optional body.

On responses, the request line is substituted by
the **status line**: `<version> <status code> <message>`.
Or something like `HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found`.

Headers are name-value pairs that give some useful meta-data.
Things like content type, referer, user agent or cookies are sent as headers.

The obvious case for bodies are standard 200 responses:
the body here is just the HTML content to be displayed.
Bodies are also used in POST and PUT requests, where
they carry the content to be uploaded.
